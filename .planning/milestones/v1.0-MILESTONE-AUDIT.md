### Orphaned Requirements (in ROADMAP but not in REQUIREMENTS.md)
- INFRA-01..04 (Phase 5.1) — not in traceability table, no VERIFICATION.md, but production confirms
- NAMING-01..05 (Phase 7) — not in traceability table, VERIFICATION.md passed

## Tech Debt Summary

**Total: 9 items across 7 phases**

See YAML frontmatter for full list. Key items:
1. Kinescope React player broken — using iframe workaround
2. Only 1 E2E test (landing) — auth/diagnostic/learning deferred
3. UX spinner timing during AI question generation
4. In-memory activeSessionQuestions pattern
5. Hardcoded Prisma version in Dockerfile

## E2E Production Flows (Human-Verified)

All 5 critical flows confirmed on https://academyal.duckdns.org:
1. Landing → OAuth → Dashboard ✅
2. Dashboard → Diagnostic → AI Questions → Results → Radar Chart ✅
3. Results → Recommended Path → Learn → "Мой трек" ✅
4. Lesson → Kinescope Video → RAG Summary → Chat ✅
5. Chat timecode → Video seek ✅

## Conclusion

Milestone v1.0 is ready for completion. All 33 requirements satisfied through phase verifications. Tech debt is non-critical and tracked. Documentation gaps (checkbox updates, missing VERIFICATION for 5.1) should be addressed during milestone archival.
